# Life Goals XP Tracker

A lightweight React + TypeScript web app for tracking life categories, monthly XP, bonus quests, and a year capsule — all stored locally in your browser.

## Getting started
1. Install dependencies (Node 18+):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production:
   ```bash

   ```

## Features
- Hard-coded six life categories with icons and colors.
- Monthly review cards with 0–3 XP selector and reflection prompts.
- Bonus quest log that can award XP to categories.
- Year capsule for memories, wins, lessons, dreams, quotes, and more with filters and search.
- Anchor goals per category and yearly dashboard summaries.
- Data persisted to `localStorage` under one key (`xp_tracker_state_v1`).
